# Dequeue

Deque or Double Ended Queue is a generalized version of Queue data structure that allows insert and delete at both ends.

- Deque can act as both Stack and Queue
- It is useful in many problems where we need to have a subset of all operations also like insert/remove at front and insert/remove at the end.

- It is typically implemented either using a doubly linked list or circular array.

### Operations on Deque: 
Mainly the following basic operations are performed on queue: 

**insertFront():** Adds an item at the front of Deque.

**insertRear():** Adds an item at the rear of Deque. 

**deleteFront():** Deletes an item from front of Deque. 

**deleteRear():** Deletes an item from rear of Deque.

**frontEle():** Gets the front item from queue. 

**RearEle():** Gets the last item from queue.
